  * What is the most influential book or blog post youâ€™ve read regarding web development?
          - I haven't read any book or blogs about the Web Development. I have read only Udacity Documentation. Before I have started this udacity course, I have finished some projects using HTML,PHP with MYSQL. That was not a proper code what I did.
